# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis
The propose of the analysis is to compare the quantity and fares of rides in the three different city types, urban, suburban, and rural and address the disparities among the city types with matplotlib library.

## Results:
To better visualize the differences between the three city types, I merged the ride dataset and city dataset together, and created a new summary DataFrame and a multiple-line chart. From the new DataFrame, we can see that riding service in urban cities is much more popular than in suburban cities and rural cities. The total fares generated from urban cities is much more than both suburban and rural cities altogether. However, the average fare per driver in urban cities is much less than the other two different city types. There might be too many drivers serving in that area. The data shows that there is 2,405 drivers for only 1,625 rides. That means some of the drivers did not even have a chance to serve a single ride.

## Summary:
Recommendations to the CEO:
* Reduce the drivers in some of the urban cities. 
* More advertisements for suburban and rural cities. 
* Incentive programes for drivers to make sure the best service is delivered.
